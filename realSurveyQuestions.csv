1	 "In 1859, Riemann wrote "Ueber die Anzahl der Primzahlen unter einer gegebenen Grösse" (On the Number of Prime Numbers less than a Given Quantitity). This short paper is one of the most significant pieces of writing in human history."	 False	 Mathematics
1	 "Bernhard Riemann's key insight was the generalization of geometry to encompass spaces of any dimension and curvature, laying the foundation for Riemannian geometry. He proposed that geometric spaces need not be flat (as in Euclidean geometry) but can be curved."	 True	 Mathematics
2	 "Melanin plays several roles in the health of the retina and RPE. The ovoid-shaped melanin pigment granules that align with apical microvilli act to reduce light scatter by absorbing stray photons not absorbed by the photoreceptors."	 False	 Anatomy
2	 "Melanin in the eye and orbit serves several essential functions related to visual acuity and ocular protection. Primarily located in the uveal tract—which includes the iris, ciliary body, and choroid—and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)."	 True	 Anatomy
3	 "The nasociliary nerve provides sensory fibers for the cornea, bulbar conjunctiva, and uvea, but, beyond the eye, it also runs an extensive course that serves additional structures within and outside of the orbit. After dividing from the ophthalmic..."	 False	 Anatomy
3	 “The nasociliary nerve is a key sensory branch of the ophthalmic division (V1) of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) that plays a crucial role in the anatomy of the eye and orbit. Entering the orbit through the superior orbital fissure, it provides... ”	 True	 Anatomy
4	 "The smooth ER functions in diverse metabolic processes, which vary with cell type. These processes include synthesis of lipids, metabolism of carbohydrates, detoxification of drugs and poisons, and storage of calcium ions. Enzymes of the smooth ER are... "	 False	 Anatomy
4	 "The smooth endoplasmic reticulum (smooth ER) is a vital cellular organelle characterized by a network of tubular membranes lacking ribosomes, distinguishing it from the rough ER. It plays a multifaceted role in various metabolic processes essential for..."	 True	 Anatomy
5	 "Mitochondria are found in nearly all eukaryotic cells, including those of plants, animals, fungi, and most unicellular eukaryotes. Some cells have a single large mitochondrion, but more often a cell has hundreds or even thousands of mitochondria; the number..."	 False	 Biology
5	 Mitochondria are membrane-bound organelles found in eukaryotic cells, often called the cell's "powerhouses" because they generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through oxidative phosphorylation, supplying energy for cellular functions. They have a double membrane..."	 True	 Biology
6	 "Eavesdropping in the context of passwords refers to an adversary's attempt to learn the password by observing the user, finding a written copy of the password, or some similar attack that involves the physical proximity of user and adversary. Another form..."	 False	 Computer Science
6	 "Eavesdropping in the context of passwords refers to the unauthorized interception and monitoring of communication channels to capture sensitive authentication information, such as usernames and passwords. This security breach occurs when an attacker exploits..."	 True	 Computer Science
7	 "Muscle paralysis is the inability to move a specific muscle or muscle group and may be associated with other neurological abnormalities, including loss of sensation. Paralysis may be due to abnormalities in the brain, the spinal cord, and the nerves supplying..."	 False	 Anatomy
7	 "Muscle paralysis is a medical condition characterized by the loss of voluntary muscle function in one or more muscles. This loss can be partial (paresis) or complete (plegia) and may affect a specific region (localized paralysis) or the entire body (generalized paralysis)..."	 True	 Anatomy
8	 "Atherosclerosis is a disease that affects arteries. There is a chronic inflammatory reaction in the walls of the arteries, with deposition of cholesterol and fatty proteins. This may in turn lead to secondary calcification, with reduction in the diameter of the vessels..."	 False	 Anatomy
8	 "Atherosclerosis is a chronic, progressive disease characterized by the accumulation of lipids, cholesterol, calcium, and cellular debris within the inner lining of arterial walls. This buildup leads to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques, causing the arteries to thicken..."	 True	 Anatomy
9	"The neuronal membrane serves as a barrier to enclose the cytoplasm inside the neuron and to exclude certain substances that float in the fluid that bathes the neuron. The membrane is about 5 nm thick and is studded with proteins. As mentioned earlier, some of the membrane-associated proteins..."	 False	 Neuroscience
9	 "The neuronal membrane is a selectively permeable lipid bilayer that surrounds the neuron, playing a critical role in its electrical signaling capabilities. It contains a variety of proteins, including ion channels, pumps, and receptors, which regulate the movement of ions such as sodium..."	 True	 Anatomy
10	 "There is growing evidence that the temporal patterns of spiking in olfactory neurons are essential features of olfactory coding. Compared to many sounds and sights, odors are inherently slow stimuli, so the rapid timing of action potentials is not necessary for encoding the timing of odors..."	 False	 Neuroscience
10	 "Beyond spatial coding, which depends on the activation of specific olfactory receptor neurons by certain odorants, temporal coding focuses on the precise timing and synchronization of action potentials. This includes the rate of firing, oscillations, and sequences of neural activity over time..."	 True	 Neuroscience
