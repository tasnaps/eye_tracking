1	 "In 1859, Riemann wrote "Ueber die Anzahl der Primzahlen unter einer gegebenen Grösse" (On the Number of Prime Numbers less than a Given Quantitity). This short paper is one of the most significant pieces of writing in human history. In it, Riemann revolutionized the study of the prime counting function π(x) by emphasizing its connection not just to ζ (s) but to ζ(s) as a function of a complex variable s. This allowed him to use the tools that were simultaneously being developed for the complex analytic functions (in part by him) to understand the nature of the prime counting function π(x)."

1	 "Bernhard Riemann's key insight was the generalization of geometry to encompass spaces of any dimension and curvature, laying the foundation for Riemannian geometry. He proposed that geometric spaces need not be flat (as in Euclidean geometry) but can be curved, introducing the concept of a manifold with a metric tensor to define distances and angles locally. This groundbreaking idea allowed for the rigorous study of curved spaces and directly influenced Einstein's general theory of relativity, fundamentally reshaping our understanding of space, time, and gravity."

2	 "Melanin plays several roles in the health of the retina and RPE. The ovoid-shaped melanin pigment granules that align with apical microvilli act to reduce light scatter by absorbing stray photons not absorbed by the photoreceptors. They also act as a heat sink to reduce light-induced thermal damage to the retina. As elsewhere, including the skin, by absorbing photons not absorbed by photoreceptors, melanin also acts to protect the RPE cell DNA from photic damage and oxidative stress-induced cell death."

2	 "Melanin in the eye and orbit serves several essential functions related to visual acuity and ocular protection. Primarily located in the uveal tract—which includes the iris, ciliary body, and choroid—and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), melanin absorbs excess and scattered light within the eye, reducing glare and enhancing the clarity of visual images. This pigment also protects ocular tissues by filtering harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation and neutralizing free radicals generated by light exposure, thereby preventing photooxidative damage to the photoreceptor cells. Additionally, melanin contributes to the immune privilege of the eye by modulating inflammatory responses. Overall, melanin is vital for optimal visual performance and the protection of ocular structures."	 True	 Anatomy
3	 "The nasociliary nerve provides sensory fibers for the cornea, bulbar conjunctiva, and uvea, but, beyond the eye, it also runs an extensive course that serves additional structures within and outside of the orbit. After dividing from the ophthalmic division of CN V, the nasociliary nerve most commonly enters the orbit between the two heads of the lateral rectus muscle, as they join the annulus of Zinn. Moving anteriorly from its point of origin near the orbital apex, the nasociliary nerve enters the muscle cone, providing two to three communicating branches to the ciliary ganglion."	 False	 Anatomy
3	 “The nasociliary nerve is a key sensory branch of the ophthalmic division (V1) of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) that plays a crucial role in the anatomy of the eye and orbit. Entering the orbit through the superior orbital fissure, it provides sensory innervation to the eyeball, including the cornea and conjunctiva, via the long ciliary nerves. The nasociliary nerve also gives rise to the anterior and posterior ethmoidal nerves, which supply the mucous membranes of the nasal cavity and ethmoidal air cells, and the infratrochlear nerve, which innervates the skin of the medial eyelids and the bridge of the nose. Additionally, it contributes a sensory root to the ciliary ganglion, facilitating reflex actions like the corneal blink reflex. Overall, the nasociliary nerve is essential for transmitting sensory information from ocular structures and adjacent nasal regions.”	 True	 Anatomy
4	 "The smooth ER functions in diverse metabolic processes, which vary with cell type. These processes include synthesis of lipids, metabolism of carbohydrates, detoxification of drugs and poisons, and storage of calcium ions. Enzymes of the smooth ER are important in the synthesis of lipids, including oils, steroids, and new membrane phospholipids. Among the steroids produced by the smooth ER in animal cells are the sex hormones of vertebrates and the various steroid hormones secreted by the adrenal glands. The cells that synthesize and secrete these hormones—in the testes and ovaries, for example—are rich in smooth ER, a structural feature that fits the function of these cells. Other enzymes of the smooth ER help detoxify drugs and poisons, especially in liver cells. Detoxification usually involves adding hydroxyl groups to drug molecules, making them more soluble and easier to flush from the body. The sedative phenobarbital and other barbiturates are examples of drugs metabolized in this manner by smooth ER in liver cells."	 False	 Anatomy
4	 "The smooth endoplasmic reticulum (smooth ER) is a vital cellular organelle characterized by a network of tubular membranes lacking ribosomes, distinguishing it from the rough ER. It plays a multifaceted role in various metabolic processes essential for cell survival and function. One of its primary functions is lipid synthesis; it is responsible for the production of phospholipids and cholesterol, which are fundamental components of cellular membranes. Additionally, the smooth ER synthesizes steroid hormones in endocrine cells, such as those in the adrenal cortex and gonads. Another critical function of the smooth ER is detoxification. In liver cells, it contains enzymes that modify and neutralize harmful substances like drugs, alcohol, and metabolic waste products, making them more water-soluble for excretion. The smooth ER also participates in carbohydrate metabolism; in hepatocytes, it contributes to the breakdown of glycogen to glucose, aiding in blood sugar regulation. Furthermore, the smooth ER serves as a storage site for calcium ions (Ca²⁺)."	 True	 Anatomy
5	 "Mitochondria are found in nearly all eukaryotic cells, including those of plants, animals, fungi, and most unicellular eukaryotes. Some cells have a single large mitochondrion, but more often a cell has hundreds or even thousands of mitochondria; the number correlates with the cell’s level of metabolic activity. For example, cells that move or contract have proportionally more mitochondria per volume than less active cells."	 False	 Biology
5	 Mitochondria are membrane-bound organelles found in eukaryotic cells, often called the cell's "powerhouses" because they generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through oxidative phosphorylation, supplying energy for cellular functions. They have a double membrane and their own DNA, reflecting their evolutionary origin. Beyond energy production, mitochondria are involved in processes like apoptosis, calcium storage, and regulation of the cell cycle and growth."	 True	 Biology
6	 "Eavesdropping in the context of passwords refers to an adversary's attempt to learn the password by observing the user, finding a written copy of the password, or some similar attack that involves the physical proximity of user and adversary. Another form of eavesdropping is keystroke logging (keylogging), in which malicious hardware or software is installed so that the attacker can capture the user's keystrokes for later analysis. A system that relies on multiple factors (e.g., password plus token or password plus biometric) is resistant to this type of attack. For a token, an analogous threat is theft of the token or physical copying of the token. Again, a multifactor protocol resists this type of attack better than a pure token protocol. The analogous threat for a biometric protocol is copying or imitating the biometric parameter so as to generate the desired template. Dynamic biometrics are less susceptible to such attacks. For static biometrics, device authentication is a useful countermeasure."	 False	 Computer Science
6	 "Eavesdropping in the context of passwords refers to the unauthorized interception and monitoring of communication channels to capture sensitive authentication information, such as usernames and passwords. This security breach occurs when an attacker exploits vulnerabilities in network communications—like unencrypted transmissions over public Wi-Fi or unsecured networks—to access confidential data being exchanged between a user and a system. Eavesdropping can be passive, where the attacker silently listens to the data flow, or active, involving manipulation of the communication to trick users into revealing their credentials. The intercepted passwords can then be used for unauthorized access, leading to data breaches, identity theft, and other malicious activities. Preventing eavesdropping involves implementing encryption protocols like SSL/TLS for secure data transmission, using strong authentication methods, and educating users about the risks associated with unsecured networks."

7	 "Muscle paralysis is the inability to move a specific muscle or muscle group and may be associated with other neurological abnormalities, including loss of sensation. Paralysis may be due to abnormalities in the brain, the spinal cord, and the nerves supplying the muscles. Major causes include stroke, trauma, poliomyelitis, and iatrogenic factors. In the long term, muscle paralysis will produce secondary muscle wasting and overall atrophy of the region due to disuse."	 False	 Anatomy
7	 "Muscle paralysis is a medical condition characterized by the loss of voluntary muscle function in one or more muscles. This loss can be partial (paresis) or complete (plegia) and may affect a specific region (localized paralysis) or the entire body (generalized paralysis). Paralysis results from disruptions in the communication pathways between the nervous system and muscles, impeding normal muscle contraction and movement."	 True	 Anatomy
8	 "Atherosclerosis is a disease that affects arteries. There is a chronic inflammatory reaction in the walls of the arteries, with deposition of cholesterol and fatty proteins. This may in turn lead to secondary calcification, with reduction in the diameter of the vessels impeding distal flow. The plaque itself may be a site for attraction of platelets that may "fall off"(embolize) distally. Plaque fissuring may occur, which allows fresh clots to form and occlude the vessel. The importance of atherosclerosis and its effects depend upon which vessel is affected. If atherosclerosis occurs in the carotid artery, small emboli may form and produce a stroke. In the heart, plaque fissuring may produce an acute vessel thrombosis, producing a myocardial infarction (heart attack). In the legs, chronic narrowing of vessels may limit the ability of the patient to walk and ultimately cause distal ischemia and gangrene of the toes."	 False	 Anatomy
8	 "Atherosclerosis is a chronic, progressive disease characterized by the accumulation of lipids, cholesterol, calcium, and cellular debris within the inner lining of arterial walls. This buildup leads to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques, causing the arteries to thicken, harden, and lose elasticity. As plaques enlarge, they narrow the arterial lumen, reducing blood flow to vital organs and tissues. Atherosclerosis is the underlying cause of many cardiovascular diseases, including coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease (stroke), and peripheral arterial disease."	 True	 Anatomy
9	"The neuronal membrane serves as a barrier to enclose the cytoplasm inside the neuron and to exclude certain substances that float in the fluid that bathes the neuron. The membrane is about 5 nm thick and is studded with proteins. As mentioned earlier, some of the membrane-associated proteins pump substances from the inside to the outside. Others form pores that regulate which substances can gain access to the inside of the neuron. An important characteristic of neurons is that the protein com- position of the membrane varies depending on whether it is in the soma, the dendrites, or the axon."	 False	 Neuroscience
9	 "The neuronal membrane is a selectively permeable lipid bilayer that surrounds the neuron, playing a critical role in its electrical signaling capabilities. It contains a variety of proteins, including ion channels, pumps, and receptors, which regulate the movement of ions such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride across the membrane. This ion regulation establishes the resting membrane potential and enables the generation and propagation of action potentials. Through these functions, the neuronal membrane facilitates rapid electrical communication within the nervous system."	 True	 Anatomy
10	 "There is growing evidence that the temporal patterns of spiking in olfactory neurons are essential features of olfactory coding. Compared to many sounds and sights, odors are inherently slow stimuli, so the rapid timing of action potentials is not necessary for encoding the timing of odors. Temporal coding. which depends on the timing of spikes, might instead encode the quality of odors. Hints about the possible importance of timing are easy to find. Researchers have known for many decades that the olfactory bulb and cortex generate oscillations of activity when odors are presented to the receptors, but the relevance of these rhythms is still unknown. Temporal patterns are also evident in the spatial odor maps, as they sometimes change shape during the presentation of a single odor."	 False	 Neuroscience
10	 "Beyond spatial coding, which depends on the activation of specific olfactory receptor neurons by certain odorants, temporal coding focuses on the precise timing and synchronization of action potentials. This includes the rate of firing, oscillations, and sequences of neural activity over time. These temporal patterns allow the olfactory system to convey detailed information about odor identity, concentration, and temporal changes in the environment. By utilizing both spatial and temporal coding, the olfactory system enhances its ability to detect and discriminate a vast array of chemical stimuli."	 True	 Neuroscience
